# [NMRiH] Hitbox Damage Fix

Fixes [this issue](https://github.com/nmrih/source-game/issues/1257)

 - Armor absorption on national guard soldiers works again. This restores the 1.09.7 behavior where they would take more hits to die.
 - Zombie heads pop as intended when hit in the face.

# Requirements
- [Sourcemod](https://www.sourcemod.net/)
- [DHooks2](https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2) if running Sourcemod older than 1.11.6820
