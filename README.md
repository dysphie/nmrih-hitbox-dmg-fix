# [NMRiH] Hitbox Damage Fix

Fixes [an issue](https://github.com/nmrih/source-game/issues/1257) introduced in NMRiH 1.10.0

 - Armor absorption on national guard soldiers has been fixed. This restores the 1.09.7 behavior where they would take many hits to die
 - Zombie heads now pop as intended when hit in the face
